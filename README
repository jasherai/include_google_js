IncludeGoogleJs
===============

IncludeGoogleJs will over ride javascript_include_tag to use Prototype and Script.aculo.us from 
Google instead of the local copy, as described at 
http://ajaxian.com/archives/announcing-ajax-libraries-api-speed-up-your-ajax-apps-with-googles-infrastructure

Thanks to Brian Hogan and Jose Fernandez for their help as I put together my first plugin.


Example
=======

Pass 

:include_google_js => true as an option to javascript_include_tag 

to use Google's copy instead of the local copy.
