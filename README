IncludeGoogleJs
===============

IncludeGoogleJs will over ride javascript_include_tag to use Prototype and Script.aculo.us from Google instead of the local copy, as described at http://ajaxian.com/archives/announcing-ajax-libraries-api-speed-up-your-ajax-apps-with-googles-infrastructure

Thanks to Brian Hogan and Jose Fernandez for their help as I put together my first plugin.


Example
=======

in config/environment.rb or any individual environment file

IncludeGoogleJs::Config.include_google_js = true

will use Google's copy instead of the local copy.
