IncludeGoogleJs
===============

IncludeGoogleJs will over ride javascript_include_tag to use Google's hosted Javascript libraries instead of the local copies, as explained at 
http://ajaxian.com/archives/announcing-ajax-libraries-api-speed-up-your-ajax-apps-with-googles-infrastructure
and announced at
http://googleajaxsearchapi.blogspot.com/2008/05/speed-up-access-to-your-favorite.html

:defaults will load Prototype and Scriptaculous
:all will load all JS files, looking to see if any of the files matches the name of any Google hosted file.
named files will load, again looking to see if any of the files matches the name of any Google hosted file.

The JS library version will be requested based on the version of the local file, if it can be determined.
This can be overridden by passing :versions => {:scriptaculous => "1.5", :jquery => "1.8"} with javascript_include_tag

Checks for a working connection to ajax.googleapis.com before switching over.

Only works in Rails 2.1 so far, will look in to getting it running on older versions soon.

Thanks to Brian Hogan and Jose Fernandez for their help as I put together my first plugin.

Installation
=======

From git:
ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/chriswarren/include_google_js.git


Example
=======

Pass 

:include_google_js => true

as an option to javascript_include_tag to use Google's copy instead of the local copy.

---
Pass 

:versions => {:scriptaculous => "1.8", :prototype => "1.6"}

as an option to javascript_include_tag to specify the version of a library to retrieve.
If this is not passed, IncludeGoogleJs will try to find the version of the library from the local file.
If this is not determined, "1" will be passed for the library version.
