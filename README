IncludeGoogleJs
===============

IncludeGoogleJs will over ride javascript_include_tag to use Google's hosted Javascript libraries instead of the local copies, as explained at 
http://ajaxian.com/archives/announcing-ajax-libraries-api-speed-up-your-ajax-apps-with-googles-infrastructure
and announced at
http://googleajaxsearchapi.blogspot.com/2008/05/speed-up-access-to-your-favorite.html

:defaults will load Prototype and Scriptaculous
:all will load all JS files, looking to see if any of the files matches the name of any Google hosted file.
named files will load, again looking to see if any of the files matches the name of any Google hosted file.

Checks for a working connection to ajax.googleapis.com before switching over.

Only works in Rails 2.1 so far, will look in to getting it running on older versions soon.

Thanks to Brian Hogan and Jose Fernandez for their help as I put together my first plugin.
